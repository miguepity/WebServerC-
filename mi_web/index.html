    <h1>Story of the Dark Side</h1>
    <p>The dark side of the Force, also known as the Bogan, or simply as Bad
      force,was an aspect of the Force.Individuals who used the dark side drew
      their power from more intense, raw and darker emotions such as fear,
      anger, hatred,passion, and aggression.The Sith were major practitioners
      of the dark side, and were the mortal enemies of the Jedi Order, who
      followed the light side of the Force. There were others such as the
      Inquisitorius, who, though not Sith, could draw upon the power
      of the dark side.
